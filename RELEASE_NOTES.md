### Breaking Changes

- **Type names no longer prefixed with `AudioBlock`** — all concrete types have been renamed for brevity:

  | Before | After |
  |---|---|
  | `AudioBlockInterleaved` | `Interleaved` |
  | `AudioBlockInterleavedView` | `InterleavedView` |
  | `AudioBlockInterleavedViewMut` | `InterleavedViewMut` |
  | `AudioBlockPlanar` | `Planar` |
  | `AudioBlockPlanarView` | `PlanarView` |
  | `AudioBlockPlanarViewMut` | `PlanarViewMut` |
  | `AudioBlockSequential` | `Sequential` |
  | `AudioBlockSequentialView` | `SequentialView` |
  | `AudioBlockSequentialViewMut` | `SequentialViewMut` |
  | `AudioBlockMono` | `Mono` |
  | `AudioBlockMonoView` | `MonoView` |
  | `AudioBlockMonoViewMut` | `MonoViewMut` |

- **`copy_from_block` now returns `Option<(u16, usize)>`** — returns `None` if the entire block was copied (exact size match), or `Some((channels_copied, frames_copied))` if a partial copy occurred.

- **`copy_from_block` no longer calls `set_visible`** — previously, `copy_from_block` resized the destination block to `min(src, dst)` channels and frames via `set_visible`. This call has been removed; the destination block's visible size is now left unchanged.

- **`copy_mono_to_all_channels` now returns `Option<usize>`** — previously returned `()`. Now returns `None` if all frames were copied (exact match), or `Some(frames_copied)` if a partial copy occurred. A new `copy_mono_to_all_channels_exact` (panicking) variant has been added.

- **`for_each_including_non_visible` / `enumerate_including_non_visible` renamed** — these methods are now called `for_each_allocated` and `enumerate_allocated` respectively, with improved documentation clarifying when to prefer them over `for_each` / `enumerate`.

### New Features

- **`mix_to_mono` now returns `Option<usize>`** — a new `mix_to_mono_exact` (panicking) variant has been added.
- **`copy_channel_to_mono` / `copy_channel_to_mono_exact`** — new ops to copy a single channel into a mono buffer.
- **`gain` method** — new `gain(S)` method on `AudioBlockOpsMut` applies a gain factor to all samples in the block.
- **Iterators now implement `ExactSizeIterator`** — `channel_iter`, `frame_iter`, and their mutable counterparts now return `ExactSizeIterator`, enabling `.len()` and better integration with iterator adapters.
- **`Default` and `Clone` for all owned types** — `Interleaved`, `Planar`, `Sequential`, and `Mono` now implement `Default` and `Clone`.

### Other Changes

- Updated `criterion` dev-dependency to `0.8.2`
- Expanded benchmark suite with `block-types` bench
- README and docs autogenerated and improved
